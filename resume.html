                    I'm a Junior Programmer and an educator at heart. I enjoy the pursuit of knowledge, solving
                    problems,
                    and mentoring others.

                    I'm looking to pursue an intersection between education and programming that doesn't involve
                    a traditional classroom.

                    world, and learning about it myself.
